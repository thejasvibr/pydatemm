short forms: TDE: time-delay/time-difference estimate

2023-08-06:
Here I tested the effect of pre-emphasised cross-correlations. Knowing the 
flight trajectory of the bats allows me to eliminate all irrelevant TDES.
The cross-correlation is thus 'pre-emphasised' from the beginning - and helps
avoid false peak detections that are not at all possible. 

The pre-emphasis is done by getting an idea of the min-max TDEs expected from 
each bat flying over a window of time for each unique channel pair. The min-max
TDE regions for each bat are then kept in the cross-correlation, and all 
regions outside of the plausible TDE regions are set to 0.
